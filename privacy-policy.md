# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the ScreenCue app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Crimson Cue Dev (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?

The Application processes limited information on your device to provide its core functionality, such as:

- Detecting which app is currently in use (via AccessibilityService) to apply time limits and visual overlays.
- Measuring usage time of selected apps.

This information is processed **locally on your device** and is **not sent to the Service Provider or any third party**. Registration is not required to use the Application.

## Location Information

This Application does not collect precise location information of your mobile device.

## Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?

No. The Application does not transmit any collected information off your device.

## Permissions Used

- **Accessibility Service**: Detects the foreground application for time limit and overlay features. Does not read or store screen content.
- **Draw Over Other Apps**: Displays a thin progress bar or full-screen overlay when a time limit is reached.

## Purchases

The Application may, in future versions, offer optional in-app purchases.  
If and when such purchases are available, payment processing will be handled by Google Play and subject to [Googleâ€™s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).  
The Service Provider will not receive your full payment information.  

## Opt-out Rights

You can stop all processing by uninstalling the Application.

## Children

The Application is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them.

## Security

All processing happens locally on your device; no information is transmitted or stored externally.
